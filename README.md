# POMv2

## Introduction

This is some follow-up work on a POM academic project. During the projects, I identified several shortcomings that I just donÂ´t feel like leaving as such.
This is also for me the opportunity to work on some skills (scripting, ML, GPU programming).

## The project

This projects consist in training Pointnet (or Pointnet++ or Pointnet2) to automatically segment a LiDAR scan of a university.
